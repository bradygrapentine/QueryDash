            This is a work in progress, so please forgive me for asking you not
            to abuse the search feature. You're welcome to try QueryDash and
            create an account, dashes, and panels, but the API requests really
            start to pile up when the search feature is used excessively. I'm
            planning a transition to an unmetered service sometime soon. Please
            reach out to me at brady.grapentine@gmail.com with QA comments,
            questions, or suggestions.
